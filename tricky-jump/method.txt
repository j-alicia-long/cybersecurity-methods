CS 4630 Assignment 4: Tricky Jump
October 11, 2018

Method: First, I examined the objdump of target.exe to locate the address of the cavity. Next, I wrote the assembly code needed to print the virus string, including the tricky jump. I placed the string stored in memory at the end of the cavity, and put the payload between the tricky jump and the string. Then, I translated the assembly code to the binary commands in hex, including the storage of the string in ascii. Finally, I wrote infect.c to read in target.exe, replace the cavity with my virus code, and write the output to a new file infected-target.exe. I was able to hardcode the cavity addresses to insert my code.


a) The file offset of the start of the function main is 0x49B

b) The file offset of the start of the function Terminate Application is 0x426

c) The file offset of the start of the function Initialize Application is 0x43A
